==============================================



Task:

    Build a basic Trakt.tv client app (http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/#)

o    Client ID: 0e7e55d561c7e688868a5ea7d2c82b17e59fde95fbc2437e809b1449850d4162

o    Client Secret: acac2f8984eff126f39d2aa53ce08366733fda1013cc6e5e09699dadbbab517f

    Show a list/grid of trending movies, with thumbnails
    Drill into a movie to fetch full summary, ratings, genres with the main poster displayed
    Add in error messages for issues like no network connectivity
    Local data cache
    Stretch goal → Completely custom UI components
    Stretch goal → Add cast and crew sections with images -> these items do not need to be clickable

You can see similar third party projects on https://trakt.tv/downloads

 

What we are looking for:

    Primarily the way you structure the networking stack and data models
    How you go about binding this to your UI
    Any extra work on custom UI components
    Good programming techniques/practices
    Any notes on what you like/dislike about the Trakt.tv API
    Feel free to use third party libraries – just not any Trakt.tv ones
